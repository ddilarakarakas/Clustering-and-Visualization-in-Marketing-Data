# Clustering and Visualization in Marketing Data

This project consists in data analysis based on the use of DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering. It has to be performed by using Python. 
The guidelines require to address specific tasks and results in project report. Well commented Python notebooks contains the code of each task.

## Data Understanding and Preparation

### Data Understanding

The dataset was explored with the analytical tools studied and a short “data understanding” report was prepared explaining the data semantics, assessing data quality, distribution of variables, and binary correlations.

### Data Preparation

Improved and prepared data quality by introducing interesting _new features_ to define customer profile and purchasing behavior.

## CLustering Analysis

The dataset was discovered using various clustering techniques, depending on the client's profile. Different algorithms and approaches were compared:

- Density-based clustering (DBSCAN)
- Hierarchical clustering
